SMM4H2023fJc1HcXPgYvS5tO	Trump is on Crestor & has a cholesterol of 233? I'm not a dr, but true story. I had a cholesterol of 218 & put on Crestor (w/weight loss). Within 6 months I was at 160 & in 9 months, I was at 136. According to today's report, Trump's from 163 last yr to 233 now.

SMM4H2023cEWb56PTTYPa6bm	He's also taking Crestor, which would stabilize his BP. He even cheats on his health!

SMM4H2023kIXKAzusVOkSvL1	His waist circumference plays a big part in his health carrying the weight. He’s taking Crestor for his cholesterol levels; that’s a sign right there his health isn’t “excellent”.

SMM4H2023xBM15JNVAraAVqQ	@USER___ @USER_____ Both are correct. Dr. Gupta is correct that his heart Calcium score indicates arterial plaque buildup and the score # is increasing. Dr. Jackson is correct that increase in Crestor dose along with diet/exercise is about all that can be done. His LDL target should be &lt;75, imo.
SMM4H2023ZWYWXPU4i0As0fS	@USER_______ Trump = crestor masimo  #truestory
SMM4H2023LczYEn7W2vtmvy7	I'd bet he has a very fatty liver with those Lipid Panel numbers. He's fooling no one. Plus cholesterol plaques in his arteries. Crestor and other cholesterol lowering drugs DO NOT PREVENT A FIRST HEART ATTACK. There is hope.
SMM4H2023enxD1N4V7CvWAbw	I know people who've been on Crestor for years. Lots of people inherit the tendency to high amounts of bad cholesterol. The doctor referred to panels in several discussions where he stated that there was not enough of an increase to suggest more testing were necessary.
SMM4H2023CyJ7lwkC7WQpqhj	Skip the Lipitor.  Just send $20 to the Church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart of Jesus . . . And they'll say a prayer for you.
SMM4H2023T3ZHMxl5cZlxtIU	223 is borderline high cholesterol. If he wasn't worried he wouldn't be on Rosuvastatin (Crestor) and daily Acetylsalicylic Acid.
SMM4H2023SWIovIbM1D4OCJK	Look it up or just make an appointment with a General practitioner & ask if those cholesterol figures with abdominal obesity (we can all see he's fat around middle) & already on Crestor, whether u should be worried.
SMM4H2023JBF64VUIXoDq1UI	No one is discussing that he is high risk, should have been on high intensity statin (20-40 mg Crestor) per @USER__________ guidelines and didn’t even need LDL tested.
SMM4H2023SIWWbjZn3aYb8S1	@USER_________ It�s not about fat shaming, it�s about lying. It�s about saying an obese 71 yo on Crestor is in excellent health. You think thousands of his minions aren�t ready for McD &amp; KFC all day everyday?
SMM4H2023AEOQlXzoZrlBAaV	And that’s AFTER he took the Valium.
SMM4H20235zbkjDkrKAv5Jam	Crestor is a heavy duty Statin. I can't take it. I take Pravastatin, which lowered by LDL to under 100. If Trump's LDL cholesterol is still 143, yeah that's bad. What is Trump's HDL b/c is that's low he's really in bad shape.

SMM4H20239PC8rzcEjmoCU3j	Sending a physician makes sense if you want relevant questions. Trump is being treated with an increase in his statin, Crestor. But believe that a sedentary 71-year-old with very high cholesterol and borderline obesity is the very picture of health.

SMM4H2023BkBvwrAxzlBAqUN	Hey, I was just listening to that doctor read off your med list. You might want to look into the number needed to treat (NNT) for Crestor since you're so smart. Look at the incidence of side effects too. More people suffer side effects than are effectively treated.

SMM4H2023iXoMkDMG7aDvvYL	Looking for #BreastCancer people who are taking or have taken anastrozole (arimidex) ... after about 9 weeks of use I am experiencing severe joint pain and swelling of the ankles and feet. Anybody else go through this? Any suggestions on how to manage it? Thank you!
SMM4H2023umKFyW2pKNjiFSO	@USER_______ Thanks for this post.I couldn't tolerate Anastrozole.Made my joints so stiff &amp; painful.Felt like an old woman. My oncologist swapped me onto Tamoxifen even though I'm post menopause.This is much better for me - some sweats but joints are fine.I'm 4/8 ER &amp; PR so marginal benefits
SMM4H20233GWFmfw464PWnCx	@USER__________ Mine is Arimidex.  I was having night sweats before this as I am in menopause but it makes it worst.  Doctor  said they can give me an anti depression to counteract it but I don't want to go down that rabbit hole so I suck it up and sleep with an ice pack on my neck
SMM4H2023MvAlSj6BJlVRRll	@USER______ Need to consider patient meds too. I had breast cancer &amp; been on Anastrol for last 5 years but a side effect can be cartilage degeneration.
SMM4H2023qDBjVwjOAGncCzS	"""Last meal before i take #Arimidex this morning. Eek! I am a little anxious.  You know, as the medication reads, """"may cause diziness"""", and """"drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle,  HTTPURL________________"""
SMM4H2023nEV5kmH6TM0KXCZ	@USER________ I had an oophorectomy and 2 years on I'm still having very bad hot flushes. Carry a hand held fan everywhere with me. Weight gain. On letrozole so bone pain. Memory loss.
SMM4H2023et2MWfQD5SwMJ4W	I'm not really moaning (I am..) but I think I've realised the cure is worse than the disease. My back, neck &amp; joints ache, knees are painful, the hot flushes are like Niagara fell &amp; everything is taking twice as long! #cancer #letrozole #drugs #sideeffects #grumpygit
SMM4H2023ikwxGbckV0xi5lK	@USER_____ I had a local recurrence on Tamoxifen. Perimenopausal. Having ovaries out so I can go onto Letrozole. Already had a bit of bone density loss in 2 years. This is to prevent osteoporosis NOT to prevent or treat bone mets
SMM4H2023JIaE40rlCTVSvkk	@USER_____ It would be a great place for sure. I'm currently going through a huge recovery for a broken leg I have had has been positivity and somewhat of a Headstrong attitude. Broke my femar shattered my knee.  7 bones in total.  It's been a tough go getting through it!
SMM4H2023meXr0ajvht7Vfzq	@USER______ @USER__________ @USER______ @USER_________ @USER____ Thank you. I hope so, too. My hip shattered after a minor fall from my bike. Total hip the next day. Because I am Factor V, I took Exemestane instead of Tamoxifen. My ortho told me my bone was a sponge, even tho' my dexa scans showed nothing.
SMM4H20238X1HSZdwLa1svjc	I'm coming off the tamoxifen &amp; going back in 3 months. It's been causing me bone/back pain, mood swings, hot flushes, depression, extreme lethargy.  Given it 4 mnths but between stopping exemestane + zoladex which crippled me, &amp; starting tamoxifen I felt so much better #fuckbc

SMM4H2023NJyODKRgvbOlJ8E	@USER___________ That's true. I was plunged into menopause by chemo, but also then Tamoxifen and then also having my ovaries out. I had to stop taking tamoxifen for 6 weeks recently:my aches and pains eased off and my flushes changed. Worse if anything...
SMM4H2023DoKMi0JtkKELatz	@USER___ I'm not on any tamoxifen etc so just chemo to blame for plunging me into menopause and the dreaded hot flushes. Are you back on it now?
SMM4H2023rjxqprhTWMEmEyU	@USER________ @USER___________ @USER________ Mostly hot flushes (which would have also been due to menopause and chemo) but also I just didn't feel right - flutters in my chest, not feeling ok in my skin that sort of thing. These were new which is why I attributed them to tamoxifen. Settled on new brand.
SMM4H2023x0tRGrh2mVLlmj7	@USER__________ Just more of the same and I don't know if they are down to post-chemo, menopause, or tamoxifen! Hot flushes, night sweats, fatigue etc. At first they made me feel a little bit odd - palpitations and generally a bit shaky. Settled down once I found this brand.
SMM4H2023BskZ87wDN0FiQw4	Not to make my Twitter a whole thing on Tamoxifen side effects but seems a fascinating one that just popped up is sore tear ducts. Yep. Like my eyelids hurt. Manageable but a bit painful.
SMM4H2023d3fYmLWZRTKt2yu	@USER______ @USER________ @USER______ My mum isn't this bad but she had breast cancer and she's still not been given the official all clear. She's developed allergies to things like mixed fruit (like sultanas etc) because of her tamoxifen, and she comes out in all sorts of rashes and swellings because of it.
SMM4H2023g9EAhA7OAvR22Zi	@USER_______ How did you get on today with the mammogram and ultrasound? Do you have long to wait for the results? Tamoxifen deffo is affecting my weight and also energy levels!
SMM4H2023h5hBuSpWcUz2IkF	Ok #bcsm I could use some ideas. Joint pain/inflammation from Tamoxifen flaring up. I'm allergic to turmeric. Already tried glucosamine. Any other suggestions?

SMM4H2023wVWUlOxZocci6No	@USER_______ @USER_________ A friend of mine did get cancer because of taking HRT for too many years. She survived her breast cancer only to die from a pulmonary embolism caused by the tamoxifen she had to take from then on. I was denied HRT because of my history of cancer - not even hormone related.
SMM4H2023iT5yJx7jbq2Uv3z	Ah morning Mother Nature, was not expecting the booty call. Though does explain some of my more neurotic behaviour last week. #Tamoxifen is a wonder drug that has kept me thriving these past 8 years, but I do hate how it buggers up my system.
SMM4H20232Iq5Sp9unR6OG1l	@USER___________ @USER_________ There was talk of switching to another drug other than tamoxifen but my oncologist sees it the best drug for me and may extend it to 10 years. I still suffer badly with hot flushes and sleepless nights which I hate!
SMM4H2023ydWEsT0oS4oyGCN	@USER__________ Interesting in that 30+ years ago I took part in clinical trials for tamoxifen. Now nearly 69 and still suffering hot flushes.
SMM4H20232AIMXwfytMzudav	Anyone else have the joint pain and the brain fog? Or am I just incredibly unique? Then again, I blamed EVERYTHING on Tamoxifen. Even bad traffic! RT @USER__________: @USER__________ Hot flashes, poor libido, dryness #LBBCchat #bcsm #bccww

I have a permanent belly now which I never had before too, although I have definitely lost a bit of the chemo blubber. I'm getting on ok with the Tamoxifen, but having mood swings and still on fire a lot
SMM4H2023TP6Y27QLtxcXup8	@USER________ I couldn't drink alcohol at all as soon as I started Tamoxifen. Made me so sick. Three years later when the Tamoxifen ended up elevating my liver enzymes significantly, it all made sense. Like I mentioned before, I got 4 yrs, 1 mth and 29 days of it. I'm good.  #LBBCchat
SMM4H2023iIdJCqzjuhRAovn	@USER_______ Hopefully you will escape the Tamoxifen fatigue! Keep resting up during radiotherapy and moisture the affected area twice a day to help prevent soreness and skin breakage! Travelling to the daily radiotherapy sessions becomes tiring on its own x
SMM4H2023G8Hsz1MV0OErSvo	@USER_________ @USER________ @USER__________ I reacted to Tamoxifen after four days of taking it. I have a chronic muscle injury that does get inflamed, but it caused my breast to swell into football size. Since I stopped taking it, it has never happened again.
SMM4H2023d9S7FjEFJ2CP8Tb	@USER________ My aunt ended up with endometrial hyperplasia from tamoxifen for BC - part of the problem is the lack of routine screening of women taking it long term - aunt's only picked up because she had heavy bleeding

SMM4H2023KIFdgOy28rJwoqr	Anyone know anything about #tamoxifen? Could it be causing my nails to break and almost stop growing? And when they do grow, they tear off
SMM4H20233uwia70d8bH2ptj	@USER__________ Ladies it does get better. Some people have a hard time with the Tamoxifen at first but it does get better. I would get GP to check out the stiff hands Alexandra. The aches get less and the energy levels get more but it does take quite some time
SMM4H2023icEMiZv3M11RA8q	@USER_ I've got a question. Should I be wondering why I've had no side effects on Tamoxifen? No sweats, flashes, nada. I'm 45 and been on almost a month...

SMM4H2023f4tsp0u6LzMLr5j	@USER________ @USER__________ Me too Jo! My nails (hands and feet) just crumble, peel and split leaving painful skin - even a year after chemo. Possibly Tamoxifen- related?
SMM4H2023v9GyIyYs4F4bKx0	@USER__________ My Oncologist took me off Tamoxifen because of the side effects I had. So far the symptoms have reduced greatly. The swelling continues unfortunately, just not as bad.

SMM4H2023m6cFyld9naWKz4g	@USE Never tried it. been on  Tramadol &amp; Gabapentin over 2.5 years after an accident &amp; operations. I struggle to stay awake, yet struggle to sleep with restless legs, buzzing in ears. Its like groundhog day and meds ruined my life.
SMM4H2023iN3jPWLXP0zdC4z	I almost choked and died on this Tylenol. Yikes.
SMM4H2023KNyRMdhn4DwVvRa	#Benzo WD sx 26: Difficulty swallowing. This was horrific on #Xanax. I lost 20 pounds and was wasting away. Changing to #Valium helped, I now only experience issues if I'm eating in public. For a long time I was terrified to eat alone, terrified of choking to death.
SMM4H2023YEt8i2jJyyrOEhV	@USER_______ OMG Ryder did the same thing with Tylenol yesterday! He choked and gagged and was so scared afterwards.
SMM4H2023qZIn87tuNwuUrEH	"""such a mistake to have gone with my """"regular"""" prescription suggestions again. 40mg of fluoxetine leaves me depressed with heart palpitations and a complete dead numbness of feeling.

SMM4H20230YNNXrqsvP4QWDC	@USER___________ My Endocrinologist told me that my thyroid has cured itself. I no longer have to take synthroid. I thought that I would be taking it for the rest of my life. I had a horrible reaction to this med. It caused my jaw to lock up and a tightness in my chest. I'm still recovering.
SMM4H2023sv69PWaS14pSUIJ	@USER______ @USER________ No, but Paxil did! Also gave me a constant gagging feeling.
SMM4H20236Liuy0rrYiOzEqK	also theres the bouts of anxiety adderall gives me and also i think it might make my brain become more unchained in hyperfocus. idk. its strange
SMM4H2023TsyLdkutwjouOAS	@USER______ @USER_______ @USER______ That's why I could not tolerate Pepcid/Famotidine. Tried it several times and every time it disrupted my acid balance, giving me severe acid reflux and pain, rather than preventing it. Paradox.
SMM4H2023HwufixmQvWsMeQ7	was hoping to make it to class but still dizzy/off balance from the codeine syrup i took before bed, no driving for sarah today!

SMM4H2023J9TirOIZcfPDFhm	@USER___________ Thank you. That is what I need to do (probably because of the same fear...?) I did try Olanzapine about 3 years ago which did help, but had to come off it because it affected my bloods.
SMM4H20234VHfGqoasUzrUZh	when i first went on HRT i took spiro and it just made me piss the bed (its a diuretic) and i felt deeply ashamed. i take cypro now and i have no shame at all

SMM4H2023UX5KUinsKDzpmOJ	Yesterday I didn't eat enough after I took my fluoxetine and spent the entire night/this morning dry heaving. Now I'm gonna be afraid to ever take it without also having, like, a three-course meal.
SMM4H2023oPWF2THoZz40Et9	1st dose of Pfizer was energizing. No other symptoms. 2nd dose gave me mild flu symptoms for a night and went away after some Tylenol.
SMM4H2023PntkJiEV9VBlS0r	@USER________ @USER___ I had to take cloroquinine for 11 weeks when I was Africa in 1992. Aside from some mild nausea and a few vivid dreams I had none of the other side effects listed. There is risk to any medication, taking over the counter tylenol wrong can lead to liver failure. Can't hurt to try

SMM4H2023Q3tIGsnEX3AjCaa	Lorazepam you know, you disorient me.  Scary
SMM4H2023kYXQfbdmL6Ij2sJ	Hydroxychloroquine kicked my backside. Took it as antimalarial.  Disorientation, elevated pulse, vivid dream state and perpetual hangover-feel (eyeache, loss of appetite).  Can't imagine what it would do to cardio compromised. #Hydroxychloroquine

SMM4H2023FvRiqgkZfDLCr65	Tylenol is NOT my best friend that bitch gave me an ulcer!!!!
SMM4H2023gSk8FLqQPwvdoid	@USER___________ Happened to me all the time. I ended up with an ulcer from how much advil I took, and then in the hospital with an accidental tylenol overdose.
SMM4H2023DGMJCiLlKEhxB9b	@USER_____ Sounds very similar to what I had..an ulcer. From taking too many Excedrin. Now I live on Prilosec &amp; yogurt..food tore my stomach up.

SMM4H2023dTCbdKZkVer7Aya	@USER_______ I took propranolol for a year, maybe, for my terrible anxiety.

SMM4H2023iTMjugVcx1d6I13	@USER____ My doctor put on a low dose of Lisinopril many years ago. Within a day, I started with a dry, hacky cough. My doctor took me off of it immediately. Apparently that is a sign of an allergic reaction. Contact your MD if that happens.
SMM4H2023rhOwcF8RerZxUXJ	@USER___________ I was on Truvada and I had dry skin and tongue. I also had nasal congestion so almost always one of my nostrils was stopped up. I stopped two months ago and I can breathe again! (the winter is drying me out but we're moisturizing)
